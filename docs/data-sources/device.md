# smallstep_device (Data Source)

A device represents a computer that can be issued x509 certificates for securely connecting to company resources.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "smallstep_device" "laptop_2" {
  id = "063cd688-c803-4e32-babe-e5940b4bd832"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) A UUID identifying this device. Read only.

### Read-Only

- `approved_at` (String) Timestamp in RFC3339 format when the device was approved to connect to company resources. Read only.
- `connected` (Boolean) The device is currently connected to Smallstep. Read only.
- `display_id` (String) An opaque identifier that may be used to link this device to an external inventory.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
- `display_name` (String) A friendly name for the device.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
- `enrolled_at` (String) Timestamp in RFC3339 format when the device first connected to Smallstep. Read only.
- `high_assurance` (Boolean) The device has been issued certificates using high assurance device attestation. Read only.
- `last_seen` (String) Timestamp in RFC3339 format when the device last connected to Smallstep. Read only.
- `metadata` (Map of String) A map of key-value pairs available as template data when a provisioner with a webhook is used to issue a certificate to a device.
- `os` (String) The device operating system.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
 Allowed values: `Linux` `Windows` `macOS` `iOS` `tvOS` `watchOS` `visionOS`
- `ownership` (String) Whether the device is owned by the user or the company.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
 Allowed values: `company` `user`
- `permanent_identifier` (String) The cryptographic identity of the device. High-assurance devices are only issued certificates when this identifier is attested by a trusted source. All devices with the same permanent identifier appear as a single device in the Smallstep API. For Windows and Linux devices this is the hash of the TPM endorsement key and for Apple devices it is the serial number.
- `serial` (String) The serial number of the device.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
- `tags` (Set of String) A set of tags that can be used to group devices.
- `user` (Attributes) The user that a device is assigned to. A device cannot be approved for high-assurance certificates until a user has been assigned to it. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--user))

<a id="nestedatt--user"></a>
### Nested Schema for `user`

Read-Only:

- `display_name` (String) Full name of the user the device is assigned to. Synced from team's identity provider. Read only.
- `email` (String) Email of the user the device is assigned to.
This field may be populated with a value derived from data synced from your team's MDMs.
Setting this value explicitly will mask any MDM-derived value.
