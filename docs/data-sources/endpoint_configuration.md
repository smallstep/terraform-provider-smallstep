- `certificate_info` (Attributes) Details on a managed certificate (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--certificate_info))
- `hooks` (Attributes) The collection of commands to run when a certificate for a managed endpoint is signed or renewed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--hooks))
- `key_info` (Attributes) The attributes of the cryptographic key. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--key_info))
- `kind` (String) The kind of endpoint this configuration applies to. Allowed values: `DEVICE` `WORKLOAD` `PEOPLE`
- `name` (String) The name of the endpoint configuration.
- `provisioner_name` (String) Name of the provisioner on the authority that will authorize certificates for the endpoint.

<a id="nestedatt--key_info"></a>
### Nested Schema for `key_info`

Read-Only:

- `format` (String) The format used to encode the private key. For X509 keys the default format is SEC 1 for ECDSA keys, PKCS#1 for RSA keys and PKCS#8 for ED25519 keys. For SSH keys the default format is always the OPENSSH format. Allowed values: `DEFAULT` `PKCS8` `OPENSSH` `DER`
- `pub_file` (String) A CSR or SSH public key to use instead of generating one.

### Nested Schema for `reload_info`

Read-Only:

- `method` (String) Ways an endpoint can reload a certificate. `AUTOMATIC` means the process is able to detect and reload new certificates automatically. `CUSTOM` means a custom command must be run to trigger the workload to reload the certificates. `SIGNAL` will configure the agent to send a signal to the process in pidFile. Allowed values: `AUTOMATIC` `CUSTOM` `SIGNAL`
- `pid_file` (String) File that holds the pid of the process to signal. Required when method is SIGNAL.
- `signal` (Number) The signal to send to a process when a certificate should be reloaded. Required when method is SIGNAL.
